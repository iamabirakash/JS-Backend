The mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 package is a useful plugin for Mongoose that adds pagination functionality to Mongoose aggregation queries. It simplifies the process of paginating large datasets that are retrieved using Mongoose's aggregation framework, which is typically more complex than simple queries due to the powerful data processing capabilities it provides.
